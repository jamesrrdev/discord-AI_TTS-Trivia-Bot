Changelog

Alpha Version [0.1] - 2024-08-05

New Features

- Added a test command of "!hi" which the bot responds with "Hello!"

- Added text-to-speak feature, user types !tts followed by their message. An mp3 file is created with that TTS message, the bot joins the user's vc and plays this mp3.

Notes

- Need to figure out how STT will be implemented.
